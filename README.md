Current authors: PieRGud, fiskey111

**Current Features**
- Ability to search for persons and vehicles without keys conflicting with other mods.
- Uses the LSPDFR API to get ped and vehicle information. Also includes info left out of the regular LSPDFR police computer, like times stopped and number of citations.
- Uses the Traffic Policer API (if it is installed) to also show a vehicle's insurance information.
- Search fields are automatically filled out with the subject's information during a traffic stop, so all you have to do is press a button!
- Dynamic backgrounds! Depending on which police vehicle you're in, you'll get a specialized department background. Comes with RDE support.
- Looks practically identical to the LCPDFR computer (in terms of the layout).

**Planned Improvements**
- Integration with Albo1125's British Policing Script and soon to be released LSPDFR+.
- Combining Computer+ and fiskey111's LSPDFR PolicingMDT into one mod.
- Adding a CAD-like system and an accompanying API so callout developers can show information about currently running callouts.
